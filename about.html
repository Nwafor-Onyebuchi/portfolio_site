       <p class="dark">
	   Think about it this way. How did the factors of your life over which you had practically no control come about? The family you were born into (which is what most people call the background factor), the time of your birth, your skin color and so on. What about your natural aptitude, gifting, talent and temperaments? How did God determine them?
	   </p>	   
	   <p class="dark">
	   The truth is that you were uniquely designed to fit into your purpose. Nothing is as awkward as someone trying to do something for which he is ill fitted. It’s like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. It’s like someone designed for ministry trying to fit into secular business. It is like someone designed to meet a major need in the world of medicine trying to fit into the world of politics.

	   <h3> What We Do</h3>
	   <p>
	   Here is the point. There’s a reason why you are either black or white. There is a reason you were born into your family. There’s a reason why you are existing in a time like this. Your complexion, your height, your natural make-up, your talents, your temperament and aptitude are not just a random factorial combination of programs and features. They are all in sync with the need you were created to meet in your generation in your lifetime.
